      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each year I get a crazy idea for a great gift for one of my family members. I do my best to get everyone in my family something they’ll like or appreciate, but usually there is one person that I think ‘Wow, this would be a great gift for them!’. This year it was my Dad. On a day that I got lost on the internet I found that there was such a thing as &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bartop+arcade+cabinet&#34;&gt;bartop arcade cabinet kits&lt;/a&gt; that take up a fraction of the space of normal arcade cabinets. My Dad has raved about getting a full-blown arcade machine for years but the progress on acquiring one has been slow. After carefully analyzing my budget for Q4 I decided I could just barely afford to build one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My 3rd day of class started out with the unpleasant realization that my server was offline as of 4:30 this morning. I got the notice from my Uptime Robot who monitors the web server. I assumed that it was either a problem with my nginx frontend not starting automatically after a VM crash or a loss of internet to the house. Since I didn’t realize the problem until I was in class there wasn’t much I could do. My VPN has been a work-in-progress, and I now realized that the work on that particular project needs to get finished soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
