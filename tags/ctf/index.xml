      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished the Hacktober 2019 CTF from the great folks &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/uvucsc&#34;&gt;@UVUCSC&lt;/a&gt;. The challenges were mostly entry-level but there were a few that were quite challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The highest-point-value challenge was a frustrating and time-consuming monster developed by my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddbishop/&#34;&gt;chuck&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;code&gt;filesystems&lt;/code&gt;. I was the only solver of the challenge and was asked to do a write up of it, and because it was such a twisted and annoying challenge (that I learned a lot from) I decided to go ahead and do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
