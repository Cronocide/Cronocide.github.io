      <title>Building your first SIEM with the Elastic Stack</title>

      <description>Preface This process is an exercise in installing and configuring Elastic Stack components for use as a SIEM. Normally you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t install all of these services on a single host: you should consider the resource consumption of each host and distribute your services appropriately.
After we get the basic software running we&amp;rsquo;ll do a few example searches and create an example alert. The power of your SIEM will be determined by how many detections you implement and what kind of alerts you use.</description>

      <description>I recently finished the Hacktober 2019 CTF from the great folks @UVUCSC. The challenges were mostly entry-level but there were a few that were quite challenging.
The highest-point-value challenge was a frustrating and time-consuming monster developed by my friend chuck called filesystems. I was the only solver of the challenge and was asked to do a write up of it, and because it was such a twisted and annoying challenge (that I learned a lot from) I decided to go ahead and do it.</description>
