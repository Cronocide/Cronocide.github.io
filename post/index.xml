      <title>Building your first SIEM with the Elastic Stack</title>
      <link>https://www.cronocide.com/post/byfswtes/</link>

      <description>Preface This process is an exercise in installing and configuring Elastic Stack components for use as a SIEM. Normally you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t install all of these services on a single host: you should consider the resource consumption of each host and distribute your services appropriately.
After we get the basic software running we&amp;rsquo;ll do a few example searches and create an example alert. The power of your SIEM will be determined by how many detections you implement and what kind of alerts you use.</description>

      <title>Hacktober 2019 - Filesystems</title>

      <description>I recently finished the Hacktober 2019 CTF from the great folks @UVUCSC. The challenges were mostly entry-level but there were a few that were quite challenging.
The highest-point-value challenge was a frustrating and time-consuming monster developed by my friend chuck called filesystems. I was the only solver of the challenge and was asked to do a write up of it, and because it was such a twisted and annoying challenge (that I learned a lot from) I decided to go ahead and do it.</description>

      <title>Enable iMessage on Mac for ESXi (in 2017)</title>

      <description>Running virtual Macs on ESXi is a great way to become familiar with the operating system and server software without buying your own Mac lab. To install MacOS on ESXI 5.5 and above is pretty trivial, since VMWare’s hypervisor almost natively supports the OS. There are several steps that must be done however before the OS will boot properly, and even still, before iMessage will work.
To install MacOS you will need a legitimate installer for the operating system, which can be produced by any Mac that has purchased the OS.</description>

      <title>Building a Tabletop Arcade Cabinet with RetroArch on RetroPi</title>

      <description>Each year I get a crazy idea for a great gift for one of my family members. I do my best to get everyone in my family something they’ll like or appreciate, but usually there is one person that I think ‘Wow, this would be a great gift for them!’. This year it was my Dad. On a day that I got lost on the internet I found that there was such a thing as bartop arcade cabinet kits that take up a fraction of the space of normal arcade cabinets.</description>

      <title>Enable 2FA SSH for Mac</title>

      <description>I’ve been using two-factor authentication with Authy now for awhile and have really enjoyed the flexibility of being able to control all of my logins with 2FA. I got to thinking to myself “Wouldn’t it be cool if I could use 2FA on my SSH logins?”
Well, it turns out that you can! I recently followed a tutorial by servinglinux.com and with little adaptation was able to get 2FA working beautifully on my Macs.</description>

      <title>Scrubbing File Metadata with exiftool</title>

      <description>The files that we upload and send all over the internet have a lot of data attached to them that we often forget about. This metadata can tell others a lot about us that we don’t necessarily need other people to know. Picture files like JPEGs, PNGs, and even GIFs can hold metadata with custom values that show information about the history of the file.
In my case, I hate sending any technical information about my system to potential employers with embedded metadata in my job application.</description>

      <title>Searching all your Mac’s downloads</title>

      <description>Now and then I’ll download something and store it somewhere I can’t find later. Usually I rename downloaded files to something closer to what I think they ought to be called, and then forget what clever name I gave them. Sometimes I delete files that I can’t find the source for. For one reason or another, I lose downloads sometimes.
Fortunately your Mac keeps track of all the files you download.</description>

      <title>Swapping Bytes with dd</title>
      <link>https://www.cronocide.com/post/sbwd/</link>

      <description>I was reading in the man page for dd and found that some of the conversion options for it are kind of fun. One of these options, the swab conversion, swaps every two bytes of the input file and sticks them in the output file. The resulting file is usually not readable (if it is a binary) and pretty obfuscated if it is text. The usage is like this:
dd if=(input file) of=(output file) conv=swab</description>

      <title>Installing Homebrew on Mac</title>

      <description>I often receive complaints from developers and administrators about the lack of a centralized package system on the Mac. While Apple did provide installer, the Darwin-era package installation app, it did not really have any sort of repository system until the App Store was released with Snow Leopard. MacPorts, the successor of DarwinPorts, was the de-facto package manager for enthusiasts for a long time. But in recent years a lot of the community has switched over to Homebrew for their package management.</description>

      <title>Saving an ESXi Datastore from a Foreign Config</title>

      <description>My 3rd day of class started out with the unpleasant realization that my server was offline as of 4:30 this morning. I got the notice from my Uptime Robot who monitors the web server. I assumed that it was either a problem with my nginx frontend not starting automatically after a VM crash or a loss of internet to the house. Since I didn’t realize the problem until I was in class there wasn’t much I could do.</description>

      <title>Setting up a Vagrant Box on Mac</title>

      <description>This year I’ll be working with several different operating systems for school. I want to run each of them as natively as I can on my production machine without having to un-boot my production Mac environment. Virtualization is the obvious answer.
If you’re anything like me you’ve always been turned off by the graphical interfaces for Virtualbox and VMWare. Personally, I’ve always preferred to work in a command-line environment anyway. I’m going to use something called vagrant to boot a pre-configured VM and get me SSH’ed into it.</description>

      <title>Edit Mac Terminal Prompt</title>

      <description>As you SSH around different devices running varying operating systems and shells you see quite a variety of shell prompts. I’ve decided that my prompt should give me the username and host of the machine I am trying to connect to, as well as the full path of the working directory. This way the prompt is always ready to be copied for an scp argument. I’ve decided that I want to standardize my prompts with this information, and it’s pretty easy to do.</description>
